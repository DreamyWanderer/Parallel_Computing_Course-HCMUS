Introduction to basic implementation of CUDA

## Lab 1

Practice basic parallel computation using 2D grids and blocks. At this stage, we only care about the final result, not performance yet. The demonstrated problems are:

- Convert RGB image to grayscale one.
- Use convolution product to blur image using given kernel.
